## an attempt at nlp

This repository is for personal education, as I would like to better understand
how natural language processing works. I will add descriptions as to what each 
of the folders mean below, as they appear. I will try to keep my files well
documented so that I can look back and remember what each of the functions do/mean.

Folders:
 - `simple` - Practicing simple functions.
 - More to be added.
